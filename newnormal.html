            <p>While the Philippines will be reopening up to 120 schools for limited face-to-face classes in a pilot run approved by President Rodrigo Duterte, millions of Filipino students would likely not experience the same learning setup even after the pandemic.<br><br>

                In an interview on Thursday, October 21, Education Assistant Secretary Malcolm Garma said that the “new normal” in education would not be a “purely classroom setup.”<br><br>
                
                “What I see is that the new normal would be a combination of the school-based and home-based. Hindi na talaga ‘yung purely classroom ang ating new normal in education (The new normal in education won’t be a purely classroom setup anymore),” he said.<br><br>
                
                For two pandemic school openings, students had to stay at home as they continue their education via the distance learning system, which has been widely criticized due to its poor implementation.<br><br>
                
                There has been an ongoing debate about opening schools during a pandemic. While most students and parents have been urging the government for a gradual reopening of schools, a number of them are also anxious about this move, considering the health risks involved.<br><br>
                
                Until the pilot run starts on November 15, the Philippines will remain one of the last two countries that have yet to reopen schools for in-person classes since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020, with the other country being Venezuela.</p>
